## Findings:
Unsuprisingly, Movies and TV Episodes dealing with a Pandemic or Quarantine spiked dramatically starting with the 2020 COVID Pandemic.

TV Episodes spiked harder in 2020, likely owing to lower production time, and tapered off back to pre-COVID levels as early as 2021.

Movies, on the otherhand, continued to spike into 2021, and even 2022. While the quantity of Quarantine/Pandemic movies decreased significantly in 2023, the average rating for the movies had a noteable increase, indicating quality over quantity.
